        specifications, as opposed to adoption by reference or underlying
        technology not defined in the proposed spec. Key use cases are often
        helpful in describing scope. If no specifications will be defined in the
        group that the CLA patent section applies to, the charter should clearly

            This specification will basically be an updated and slightly extended version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#part1">first part the SHACL 1.0 spec</a>.
            It should fix some unfinished issues in SHACL 1.0, such as recursion.

            This specification will define a richer vocabulary that can be queried by user interface tools to produce renderings of RDF graphs,
            in particular for viewing and editing RDF resources on forms.
            An example starting point is the <a href="https://datashapes.org/forms.html">DASH vocabulary</a>.

          <p>
            This specification will define a SHACL vocabulary to represent inferencing rules that can be used to infer new RDF statements from existing statements.
            A starting point may be the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-af/#node-expressions">Node Expressions</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-af/#rules">SHACL Rules</a>

            This specification will define methods for using SHACL to create formal profiles of (RDF) standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            This work will likely build on the profile definitions of the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/">Profiles Vocabulary</a> which has been used extensively with SHACL constraints and the proposed <strong>SHACL 1.2 Inferencing Rules</strong>.

        As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
        commitments under the <a href=
        'https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/'>W3C Community
        Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
        participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
        W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
        following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
        commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
        make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
        The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
        how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.

        The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group
        uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories
        (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions
        can be tracked through a software tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
        summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or
        to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.
      </p>
      <h2 id="decisions">
        Decision Process
      </h2>
      <p class="remove">
        If the decision policy is documented somewhere, update this section accordingly to link to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
        are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
        earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
        consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
        clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
        feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
        participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
        contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
        due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
        recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
      </p>
      <p>
        If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
        group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
        Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
        a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
        choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
        taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
        preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
        experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
        ahead with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
        in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
        public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
        at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
        decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
        objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
        objection according to this decision process.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
        fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
        or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
      </p>
      <h2 id="chairs">
        Chair Selection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
        Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
        participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
        the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
        with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
        operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
        "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
        announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
        participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
        candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
        candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
        </li>
        <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
        candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
        The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
        organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
        break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
        Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
        after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
      </p>

        Amendments to this Charter
      </h2>
      <p>
        The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
        text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
        The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
        conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
        approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
        or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
        later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
        vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
        as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
        this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
        for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
        process or rules for amending the charter.
